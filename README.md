# Blue-Prism-RPA
Blue Prism is an enterprise-grade intelligent robotic process automation (RPA) platform.
ENTERPRISE-GRADE INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION: DO MORE WITH LESS
Blue Prism is an enterprise-grade intelligent platform that lets organizations do more with less, freeing employees’ time to focus on tasks that require uniquely human qualities – such as emotional intelligence, reasoning, judgment, and direct customer interaction. 

BUILT FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Built on .Net & SQL with Azure as a primary reference architecture, Blue Prism runs on Azure either in the customer tenant, or as a SaaS/managed services platform using Blue Prism Cloud.
Our platform can be provisioned on Azure, making it easier for customers to drive digital transformation quickly, securely, and with full compliance for regulated industries.

SECURITY, IRREFUTABLE AUDIT TRAILS
Just as with a human workforce, a digital workforce also requires security, oversight, and governance.
Blue Prism has been specifically designed to meet strict enterprise security and compliance needs, including controls for how digital workers are configured and how changes are managed and approved.
This includes comprehensive & irrefutable audit trails and non-repudiation, as well as enterprise-wide password & credential vaults and credential management.


MAKING AI EASIER TO ACCESS & CONSUME

Integration with Azure Cognitive Services and Machine Learning: Customers can leverage either natively within the Blue Prism Cloud platform, or through simple drag and drop functionality within the core Blue Prism automation platform.
The only intelligent automation platform with a Power Platform integration: The new Blue Prism Connector for Microsoft Power Platform makes it possible for users to include Blue Prism processes within new or existing Microsoft PowerApps, and within Power Automate business processes.
Organizations can easily integrate with each component of the Power Platform – including Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents – and with the entire Microsoft ecosystem.
Users also get access to a full universe of connectors from both Microsoft’s Power Automate gallery and the Blue Prism Digital Exchange.
